-- Answer to question (b)
-- It is inefficient to repeat the operator name in every row because it increases redundancy and the size of the table.
-- A better approach is to create a separate table for operators with a unique ID,
-- and then reference this ID in the main table (US_gas_production) using Operator_ID.
